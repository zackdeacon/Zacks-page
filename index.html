                <p>When Messi is a bit older (bigger) and fully vaccinated, I cant wait to bring him with me on some hikes in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. 
                    I am a very avid hiker and am excited for the weather to turn for the better so that i can start hiking every weekend.
                I have been on two hikes in the last few weeks.I went to Poo Poo point and i also hiked Little Si over memorial day weekend. 
                 you have never been hiking before or are curious about where you can go to hike, check out the link below. 
                WTA stands for Washington Trails Association and its where i go to get all of my hiking suggestions and recent trail report information. Cheers!
